                                MakeJob  *makejob* *vim-makejob*

This is a plugin for folks who think that Vim's quickfix feature is
great, but who don't like how calls to |:make| and |:grep| freeze the
editor. MakeJob implements asynchronous versions of the builtin
commands in just a couple hundred lines of Vimscript.

1. MakeJob Commands                     *makejob-commands*

Here are your new quickfix commands.

                                        *makejob-MakeJob* *:MakeJob*
MakeJob[!] [{filename}]     Start a MakeJob on the specified buffer,
                            populating findings in the quickfix list.
                            |makeprg| and |errorformat| must be set before
                            MakeJob is called. {filename}, if specified, is
                            the name of the file to make, and is appended to
                            the end of |makeprg|. Ex special characters are
                            expanded (see |cmdline-special|). |autowrite|,
                            |QuickFixCmdPre|, and |QuickFixCmdPost| all work
                            as expected. While the job runs, output will be
                            directed to a preview buffer below the active
                            buffer. If [!] is not given, the first error is
                            jumped to.

                            <C-c> can be used in normal mode to cancel a
                            running MakeJob, provided the current buffer
                            either spawned it or is showing its output.
                            Otherwise |:MakeJobStop| can be used.

                                        *makejob-LmakeJob* *:LmakeJob*
LmakeJob[!] [{filename}]    Same as ":MakeJob", except the location list for
                            the current window is used instead of the quickfix
                            list.

                                        *makejob-GrepJob* *:GrepJob*
GrepJob[!] {filename}       Run the grep command specified in |grepprg| and
                            read into the quickfix list using |grepformat|.
                            {filename} must be specified, but can contain
                            wildcards.

                                        *makejob-LgrepJob* *:LgrepJob*
LgrepJob[!] {filename}      Same as ":GrepJob", except the location list for
                            the current window is used instead of the quickfix
                            list.

                                        *makejob-GrepaddJob* *:GrepaddJob*
GrepaddJob[!] {filename}    Same as ":GrepJob", but add findings to the
                            quickfix list without clearing it first.

                                        *makejob-LgrepaddJob* *:LgrepaddJob*
LgrepaddJob[!] {filename}   Same as ":GrepaddJob", but add findings to the
                            location list without clearing it first.

                                        *makejob-MakeJobStop* *:MakeJobStop*
MakeJobStop [{MakeJob}]     Use this command to cancel a running MakeJob.
    
                            Without an argument, the command will cancel a
                            running MakeJob in one of two ways:
                                1. If the current buffer spawned a MakeJob,
                                   that job will be stopped.
                                2. If the current buffer is displaying MakeJob
                                output, that job will stopped.
    
                            MakeJobStop also accepts as an argument the name
                            of the MakeJob to stop (e.g., ":MakeJobStop
                            make"). Command completion can be used to make
                            finding the name easier.

2. CONFIGURATION                        *makejob-configuration*

                                        *g:makejob_hide_preview_window*
                                        number (default 0)
g:makejob_hide_preview_window       Hide the preview window during execution.
                                    Default (0) is to show the preview window.
                                    Set to 1 to hide it.
